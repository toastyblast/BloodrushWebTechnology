    <h2 class="left">Bloodrush's gameplay</h2>
    <section class="left">Bloodrush is a game that has elements from many genres. Firstly, it's a turn-based arena
        survival game. Every time you move, the enemies move as well. The game will also spawn powerups and bonuses for
        you to collect. If a monster steps next to you, you can kill them. But do you move into their range? Then they
        defeat you! The point is to live as long as possible. Collecting bonuses and killing monsters will start a
        multiplier. You can also hold one powerup at a time, useful for getting out of sticky situations! Every set
        amount of turns survived will also cause the board to generate a new layout, and the longer you survive, the
        more frequent monsters will spawn! But that's not all. To give you even more chances at getting that new high
        score, the game also generates three random quests at a time. When you complete one, a more difficult one will
        take its place, and you'll be rewarded with more score!
        <br><br>Bloodrush's compelling gameplay will get anyone intrigued. Due to its easy controls and simple rules,
        it's also easy to learn, yet hard to master. Score attack fans will love the game as well, as they can compare
        their leaderboards to that of friends. Even achievement hunters have been taken care of, as the game has a wide
        array of achievements to complete! Due to a randomly generated board layout, it'll never bore either. Not only
        the board is random either, as monsters, quests and powerups are randomly spawned too!
        <br><br>Can you handle the Bloodrush induced by this game? Then what are you waiting for? Download it for free
        now!

    <h2 class="right">Features</h2>
    <section class="right">Packed to the brim with all kinds of features, Bloodrush will always have something for
        anyone! Play the game for yourself to see it all, but here's what we think is most important:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Randomly generated arena layouts, which are refreshed at the start of each game and every thirty turns
                survived.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two types of monsters: Watch out for the feared brute, which runs after you. Stay aware of your
                surroundings, as a spearman might throw one of his spears at you!
            </li>
            <li>
                Three types of bonuses and powerups: Collect coins to get a nice score bonus and stay on the lookout
                for shields and freeze potions! A shield will protect you from one hit, and the freeze potion will stop
                all enemies currently on the board for a few turns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Quests: At the start of each game, you'll get three randomly generated quests. Once you complete one,
                you'll be rewarded with a chunk of points, followed by getting a new, harder quest. For those that
                compete with friends, completing these quests is vital, as they boost the end score you'll get!
            </li>
            <li>
                Multipliers & leaderboards: The more monsters you kill in succession, the higher your multiplier will
                get, increasing your score even further. Collecting coins will also keep your multiplier up, so be on
                the lookout for those too! Once it's game over, you can compare your high scores to the others on the
                leaderboard, and to those of your friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two difficulties: Do you think normal mode is too easy? Then try hard mode! During this monsters will
                spawn more frequently and to make it even worse, they'll also use improved tactics! To make up for this,
                the amount of score you'll get for anything will be much higher.
            </li>
            <li>
                Achievements: For the completionists out there, the game also comes with a big set of achievements to
                complete. The first few will be easy, but they'll get harder and harder the further you go on!
            </li>
        </ul>
