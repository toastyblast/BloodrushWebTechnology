    <h2 class="right">The most downloaded android game</h2>
    <section class="right">
        We don't like to brag here, over at Koala Tea Interactive, but we sure were happy when we got the statistics.
        It was rather clear: Bloodrush was popular and broke the all-time most downloaded game charts on Android. We
        were truly happy to see this, as it shows our efforts had paid off.
        <br><br>With so many people already having downloaded it, what are you waiting for? Download it now and
        experience the great Bloodrush gameplay now!
        <br><br> Disclaimer: Bloodrush isn't actually the most downloaded Android game. It's not even downloadable
        through the Play Store.

    <h2 class="left">Simple. Innovative. Compelling</h2>
    <section class="left">
        Koala Tea Interactive made Bloodrush with a certain image in mind. This resulted in a perfect indie blend and
        making the game something for everybody to enjoy. It has simple, turn-based rules wrapped up in an endless
        survival and strategy package. This makes for quick gameplay and that "One more run" feeling, hunting for score
        to beat your friends!
        <br><br>This new mix of all those genres: turn based, stategy survival, lend it an innovative twist never seen
        before, landing itself between other indie classics and breaking the mold of all the cookie-cutter copy and
        paste jobs seen everywhere on the Play Store.
        <br><br>With many achievements to complete and randomly generated maps & quests, no two games will be the same.
        Monsters also spawn randomly and adopt all kinds of tactics, especially hard-to-beat ones once you start
        playing on the "hard" difficulty. With the easy to play, but hard to master nature, there's something to love
        for everyone! Still not satisfied? Well, the game also comes with all kinds of powerups, leaderboards and
        selectable skins so that you can go all in!
