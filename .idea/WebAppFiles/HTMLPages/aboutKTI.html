    <h2 class="right">KTI's location & team</h2>
    <section class="right">
        The headquarters of Koala Tea Interactive are currently located in Saxion's Epy Drost
        building, 4th floor. This location offers the team direct access to food, plenty of space and a great view over
        the city of Enschede, the Netherlands. KTI in fact is proud to be one of the few developers situated in the
        Netherlands, especially on the mobile market.<br><br>
        Our team is made up of the four international Bachelor-IT students that set up the company, working hard to
        deliver their clients the best products possible.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Martin S. Slavov - Koala Tea Interactive's chief prototyper and developer. Martin ensures designs are
                realised and fully working as intended. He also makes sure the code is reusable and clear. If the code
                is understandable, you have to thank Martin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wouter Baltus - Together with Martin, they are the main force behind building KTI's products. He usually
                refines what Martin has built and improves the apps' usability. If the app has an creative feature,
                Wouter most likely programmed it.
            </li>
            <li>
                William Brown - As the head designer at Koala Tea Interactive, he and Yoran make sure the client gets
                what they want in a distinct and intuative design. His designs are put into action by Martin, and he's
                generally the creative mind behind the many features of the apps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yoran Kerbusch - Yoran is the other main designer at Koala Tea Interactive and the point of contact with
                their clients. He is their main writer for any documentation and often does the last checks of any
                products delivered.

    <h2 class="left">KTI's history</h2>
    <section class="left">
        Founded in 2016, Koala Tea Interactive does not have a long running history yet. The team was instanciated for
        the final project of the first year at Saxion's Bachelor-IT course. During this project, they developed their
        first Android app. This was a game called Bloodrush, unlike any seen before. Since then, the team has stuck
        together to work on their next project in the first quartile of their second year: TRIMMder.<br><br>
        TRIMMder is a Who-Is-Who style app made to be internally used by the TRIMM company, which are well known for
        their client-to-client web applications made for big corporations like Philips and KLM. The app will allow
        employees to easily find any info on their colleagues, making it easier to remember faces and forward clients
        to the right person for the job. Employees will also be able to take personal notes and choose to get
        notifications from their colleagues when it's their birthday.
